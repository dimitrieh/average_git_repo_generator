# Git Repository Generator with mockup data

This is a repository full of spoof data for the following [case study](http://example.com)

It calculates data off of the 30 top starred github repositories to get to an average!

See [script](script.sh) for all the nutty details, and complete authentication_template.json with your own details.

This should in the future be put into a docker container, as it uses jq, git and maybe some others. Very much a work in progress and only to create testing materials!

Enjoy!

[lorem generator](https://github.com/per9000/lorem) is from per9000!
